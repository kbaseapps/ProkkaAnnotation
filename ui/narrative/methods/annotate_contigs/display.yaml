parameters :
    object_ref :
        ui-name : |
            Assembly or Genome
        short-hint : |

        ui-name : |
            Scientific name
        short-hint : |
            The optional scientific name of organism (default is 'Unknown').
    output_genome_name :
        ui-name : |
            Output Genome
        short-hint : |
            The name under which the resulting Genome will be saved in the Narrative.
    kingdom :
        ui-name : |
            Kingdom
        short-hint : |
            Annotation mode: Archaea, Bacteria, Mitochondria, Viruses (default is 'Bacteria').
    genus :
        ui-name : |
            Genus
        short-hint : |
             Optional genus name: Enterococcus, Escherichia, Staphylococcus (uses genus-specific BLAST database). Note that the default is 'do not use genus-specific database.'
    gcode :
        ui-name : |
            Genetic code
        short-hint : |
             The genetic code/translation table (default is '11').
    metagenome :
        ui-name : |
            Metagenome
        short-hint : |
            Improve gene predictions for highly fragmented genomes (default is 'OFF').
    rawproduct :
        ui-name : |
            Raw product
        short-hint : |
            Do not clean up the product annotation. Note that the default is to do clean up.
    fast :
        ui-name : |
            Fast
        short-hint : |
            Fast mode. Click this checkbox to turn off CDS/product searching (default is to do CDS/product searching).
    mincontiglen :
        ui-name : |
            Min contig size
        short-hint : |
            Minimum contig size [NCBI needs 200] (default '1')

        ui-name : |
            Rfam
        short-hint : |
            Click this checkbox to enable searching for ncRNAs with Infernal+Rfam (default is 'OFF'). Note that enabling this will cause the App to run very slowly.

    <p>This App allows users to annotate either an Assemby or a Genome using the <a href="http://www.bioinformatics.net.au/software.prokka.shtml" target="_blank">Prokka</a> annotation pipeline written by Torsten Seemann.</p>

    <p>This App uses <a href="https://github.com/tseemann/prokka">Prokka version: 1.12</a>.</p>

    <p>Prokka is a software tool for the rapid annotation of prokaryotic genomes. A typical 4Mbp genome can be fully annotated in less than 20 minutes. It produces standards-compliant output files for further analysis or viewing in genome browsers. As with other 3rd-party tools in KBase, not all options available from Prokka have been exposed to the KBase user.</p>

    <p>For rRNA prediction, this App currently uses Barrnap version 0.8 (written by the author of Prokka and recommended if you prefer speed over absolute accuracy).</p>

    <p>If the input object is a genome and the 'Fast' option was not selected, the proteins will be compared to the SEED ontology and associated functions. Function and ontology reports will be created for these genomes.</p>

    <p><strong>The Results</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>The <i>Objects</i> section has a table of the data object created by the App. Click on the name of the data object to open a data viewer cell (below the currently selected cell).</li>
        <li>The <i>Summary</i> section give details about the coding and noncoding features that were created as well as the average protein length.</li>
        <li>The <i>Files</i> section (if present) has a list of the function and ontology reports that were created and can be downloaded.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p><strong>GUI Output</strong><br>The GUI output currently consists of three tabs. The &quot;Overview&quot; tab provides basic information on the annotation job, the &quot;Browse Features&quot; tab allows the user to scroll through the features that were called, and the &quot;Browse Contigs&quot; tab provides information on the contigs in the genome. Users can sort on the various types of features. Note that some features will overlap (e.g., &quot;prophage&quot; and &quot;CDS&quot;).</p>

    <p>More information on the Prokka pipeline can be found <a href=”https://github.com/kbaseapps/ProkkaAnnotation/blob/master/README.rst”>here</a>.</p>
